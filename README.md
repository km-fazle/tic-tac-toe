# Tic-Tac-Toe

A multithreaded implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe where two AI players (X and O) make random moves on a 3Ã—3 grid. The game showcases the use of C++ threads and mutex for concurrent programming.
