# Game Logic

## Overview

This page explains the core logic of the Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation, including how moves are made, how the game detects wins, and how the threads interact.

## Game Flow

1. The game initializes an empty 3Ã—3 board
2. Two player threads are created (X and O)
3. Players take turns making random moves
4. After each move, the game checks for a win or draw
5. The game ends when a player wins or the board is full (draw)
6. Results are displayed and the program exits

## Thread Synchronization

One of the key features of this implementation is the use of threads and mutexes for player synchronization:

```cpp
void player(Game& g, char mark, int id) {
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(10 * id));
    // ensures threads don't hit the mutex at the same time on startup

    while (true) {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(g.m);
        if (g.gameover) {
            break;
        }

        if (g.turn != id) {
            continue;
        }

        // Make move and check for game end conditions
        // ...

        lock.unlock();
    }
}
```

Key synchronization elements:
- Each player thread acquires a lock on the game mutex before checking or modifying the game state
- The `turn` variable controls which player can make a move
- After a player makes a move, they change the `turn` to the other player's ID
- The mutex is unlocked to allow the other player to take their turn

## Move Selection

Moves are selected randomly using C++'s random number generation facilities:

```cpp
int random_selection() {
    std::random_device rd;
    std::mt19937 gen(rd());
    std::uniform_int_distribution<> dist(0, 8);

    int rn = dist(gen);
    return rn;
}
```

The player function uses this to select random empty cells:

```cpp
int selection = random_selection();
while (g.board[selection] != ' ') {
    selection = random_selection();
}
g.board[selection] = mark;
```

## Win Detection

The game checks for wins after each move by examining all possible winning lines:

```cpp
bool check_for_win(const std::array<char, 9>& b, char mark) {
    for (auto line : win_lines) {
        if (b[line[0]] == mark && b[line[1]] == mark && b[line[2]] == mark)
            return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

The win lines are defined as:
- Rows: [0,1,2], [3,4,5], [6,7,8]
- Columns: [0,3,6], [1,4,7], [2,5,8]
- Diagonals: [0,4,8], [2,4,6]

## Game End Conditions

The game ends when one of these conditions is met:

1. **Win**: A player has three marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
   ```cpp
   if (check_for_win(g.board, mark)) {
       g.gameover = true;
       g.winner = mark;
       break;
   }
   ```

2. **Draw/Cat's Game**: All 9 cells are filled with no winner
   ```cpp
   else if (g.moves_made == 9) {
       g.gameover = true;
       g.winner = 'C';
       break;
   }
   ```

## Board Representation

The game board is represented as a one-dimensional array of 9 characters:

```cpp
std::array<char, 9> board{};
```

The positions correspond to the following grid:

```
 0 | 1 | 2
---+---+---
 3 | 4 | 5
---+---+---
 6 | 7 | 8
```

Empty cells contain a space character ' ', and player marks are 'X' and 'O'.
